            <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag to define the structure of web pages.

                This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.

            <p>Structured Query Language is a standard Database language that is used to create, maintain, and retrieve the relational database. In this article, we will discuss this in detail about SQL. Following are some interesting facts about SQL. Let’s focus on that.

                SQL is case insensitive. But it is a recommended practice to use keywords (like SELECT, UPDATE, CREATE, etc.) in capital letters and use user-defined things (like table name, column name, etc.) in small letters.
                
                We can write comments in SQL using “–” (double hyphen) at the beginning of any line. SQL is the programming language for relational databases (explained below) like MySQL, Oracle, Sybase, SQL Server, Postgre, etc. Other non-relational databases (also called NoSQL) databases like MongoDB, DynamoDB, etc. do not use SQL.
                
                Although there is an ISO standard for SQL, most of the implementations slightly vary in syntax. So we may encounter queries that work in SQL Server but do not work in MySQL.
